After a long pandemic, people got stuck in their homes.
We wanted to provide people a way out of being surrounded by 4 walls.
Our intention was to create a website where people can find a camping ground easily.
The government websites for booking a camping ground requires way too much information
and we want to eliminate and fasten the booking process.

We tried to write a website using React and make use of one of ADA bots.
